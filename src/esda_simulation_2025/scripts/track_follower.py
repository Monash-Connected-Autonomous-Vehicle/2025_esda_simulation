# This node is the main node that will handle the overall track following around the entire map. It will subscribe to the laser scan data and implement the follow the gap algorithm to navigate around the track. It will also handle switching to a different navigation strategy when the robot is within a certain distance to the goal.
# The pipeline will be as follows:
# 1. Get the track direction --> Uses lane detection, obstacle detection and corridors from LiDAR data to determine the direction of the track and the location of the goal.
# 2. Follow the gap algorithm to navigate around the track until the robot is within a certain distance to the goal.
# 3. Converts to motion e.g. Angular Velocity, Linear Velocity to navigate towards the goal.
# 4. Publish /cmd_vel to move the robot.
